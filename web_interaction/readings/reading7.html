       The idea of the handmade web is very compelling. I particularly liked what the author said about how, in the earlier days of the web, it was common and expdected that people who were online would have their own websites, instead of relying on corporations to host them and represent themselves. It's valid and accurate to compare the "handmade" quality of the web to working with tools or crafts, as they require many of the same interfaces and though processes.
