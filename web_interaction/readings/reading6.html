         This is a fascinating piece when one thinks about its context in real art. Today, impressionist or pointillist paintings are considered high quality and rare, but on the internet "blurry" or "low quality" images, even when intentional, are always seen as bad and a mistake. Will this ever change? Our perception of art suggests that it will.
