        <p> This is my homepage for Web Interaction 2019. You can find my homework by clicking at the top on "Exercises" and my reading responses by selecting "Readings". This looks much better when there is more text in it so I'm just going to fill out this paragraph a little. </p>
        <p class = "p2"> Here's a little bit about me! My name is Ellie Plass, and I'm a senior in the Journalism and Design Program at Lang, wth a minor in Creative Coding at Parsons. I love to eat, and spent my summer writing about food for a newspaper called Bklyner. </p>
