          I thought this was a very insightful piece. The way that the author talks about websites in terms of artists "needing" to have one or not makes one really consider what art and art promotion will look like even in the next ten years. Now, websites on their own are arguably a form of art, when previously many artists didn't even think of having one. It was also interesting to think about the Art Book as the precursor to websites- thinking about how we chronicle our work and what that means.
