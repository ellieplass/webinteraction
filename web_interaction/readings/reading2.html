<li class="readin"> Paul Ford, What is Code? </li>
   <p class="readin">  1. In Paul Ford's article, "What is Code?", he writes "Decades of efforts have gone into helping civilians write code as they might use a calculator or write an e-mail". What would be the implications if they succeeded? Could they ever succeed? Would it be good? Bad? </p>
          
    <p class="readin">2. Ford later writes that "Already you wander Disney World with a wristband, and it watches and tracks you; the whole place is a computer." What are some other examples of widespread, all-consuming technology like this?</p>
