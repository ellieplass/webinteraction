       These kinds of articles frustrate me. We read time and again about how these styles are valid and important, and how modern websites are all based around here. Yet, there is an expectation that we are never to make things like this, as they are too "simple", "inelegant" or "bad". When are we allowed to make websites like this? Only when we, too, and professors of coputer science? What is the talent margin for being able to create something untraditional?
