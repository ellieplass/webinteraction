<p>Hello! My name is Ellen, but everyone calls me Ellie. I’m 21 years old, and I’m originally from a fairly <a href="https://www.visitharrisonburgva.com" target="_blank">small town in Virginia</a> (with lots of mountains), but have been in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSo7177Fe1l/" target="_blank"> New York </a> for three years now. This is my last semester in the Journalism and Design program, and I am also pursuing a minor in creative coding. Throughout both programs, I’ve spent a lot of time on both web and print design, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7CiBErmkJ4" target="_blank">made some videos</a>, <a href="https://bklyner.com/author/ellenplass/" target="_blank">honed in on interviewing </a>, and made some cool pong games in Processing. I also did some data visualization, <a href="https://elliemariep.github.io/fridge/" target="_blank">made a book about the inside of people’s fridges</a>, wrote about marijuana delivery riders, interviewed a bunch of female chefs, and made a truly terrible thing called a “soundscape”.  </p>
    
        <p>  When I’m not at school (or working), you can find me <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B0OyuREhlAb/ "target="_blank">with my friends at restaurants</a>, reading books, going to shows, and pretending to love running. You can find me on Insta <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ellieplass/" target="_blank">@ellieplass</a>, and on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ellie_plass" target="_blank">@ellie_plass.</a> </p>
