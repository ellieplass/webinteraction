       This has interesting implications. At first glance, all of these guidelines make perfect sense. But, at second glance, and when thinking about all of the apps I use on my phoen, they are all incredibly similar, perhaps in part because of guideline lists like this. For instance, " Minimal use of bezels, gradients, and drop shadows keep the interface light and airy, while ensuring that content is paramount." This is an intense restriction (suggestion) on design that will become popular. What does it mean when a company that controls much of the consumer market has based its value around a certain aesthetic? Will we ever get apps that don't match iPhones?
