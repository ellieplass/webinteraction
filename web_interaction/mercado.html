           <p> "When you come face to face with a classic dish made the way it’s supposed to be, you know it. Mercado Little Spain, the labyrinth of restaurants, bars, kiosks, counters and shops tucked under Hudson Yards at the point where the High Line runs into it, can give you that experience over and over. If gazpacho has always struck you as a pointless salad run through a blender for no good reason, the one here will make you see the point after all."</p>

<p> "José Andrés, the chef, restaurateur and unofficial one-man Spanish embassy, is an owner and the perpetual motion machine that drives the project; Ferran and Albert Adrià, the brothers who led the culinary innovations at El Bulli, are among his collaborators. Mr. Andrés talks about the project as a tribute to the indoor markets like the Boqueria in Barcelona, places where you go to buy groceries and coffee and a snack, and an hour or two later find that you’ve already had a couple of glasses of wine and decided to stay for lunch." </p>
